# Barry AI Assistant

Barry is an advanced Codex-based assistant configuration focused on speed, precision, and high-leverage reasoning.

This repository now contains a runnable Barry web assistant plus the prompt,
integration, and evaluation artifacts needed to configure Barry elsewhere.

## App Files

- [src/routes/index.tsx](src/routes/index.tsx): redirects `/` to `/chat`.
- [src/routes/chat.index.tsx](src/routes/chat.index.tsx): adapted chat home from the uploaded route.
- [src/routes/chat.thread.tsx](src/routes/chat.thread.tsx): conversation view, composer, and starter-prompt execution.
- [server/index.ts](server/index.ts): local API server for Barry chat responses.
- [src/assets/barry-logo.png](src/assets/barry-logo.png): generated app logo used by the chat UI.

## Prompt And Configuration

- [prompts/barry-system.prompt.xml](prompts/barry-system.prompt.xml): the cleaned system prompt to wire into the model configuration.
- [schemas/integration-manifest.schema.json](schemas/integration-manifest.schema.json): the per-session installed skills/integrations manifest schema.
- [examples/integration-manifest.example.json](examples/integration-manifest.example.json): a sample manifest the host can inject during development.
- [src/consequence-gate.ts](src/consequence-gate.ts): a small TypeScript reference implementation for hard confirmation gates.
- [eval/evaluation-checklist.md](eval/evaluation-checklist.md): shipping checklist.
- [eval/test-conversations.md](eval/test-conversations.md): starter evaluation conversations.

## Quick Start

Barry has also been created as a draft workspace agent:

- Agent ID: `agt_6a47e8bee95c8191803019e685e4aa9b`
- Status: draft, not published
- Local record: [config/workspace-agent.created.json](config/workspace-agent.created.json)

For local development:

1. Install Node.js 22 or newer.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
4. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, or both in `.env`.
5. Run `npm run dev`.
6. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

`npm run dev` starts two processes: the Vite frontend on port `5173` and the
Barry Express API on port `8787`. Vite proxies `/api/*` requests to the Express
server during local development.

For a production-style local run, use `npm run preview`. That builds the Vite
frontend and serves both the static app and `/api/*` routes from the Express
server at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Do not use `vite preview` by itself for this
app, because it only serves frontend assets and does not own `POST /api/chat`.

## Railway Deployment

Barry's Express server reads `PORT` from the environment and binds to
`0.0.0.0` by default, which is required for Railway's router to reach the app.
Use `npm run build` as the build command and `npm start` as the start command.

Set these Railway variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: required for OpenAI / ChatGPT responses.
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: optional, defaults to `gpt-4.1`.
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: required for DeepSeek responses.
- `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`: optional, defaults to `https://api.deepseek.com`.
- `DEEPSEEK_MODEL`: optional, defaults to `deepseek-v4-pro`.
- `AI_PROVIDER`: optional default for server-side requests, `openai` or `deepseek`.

Do not set `HOST=127.0.0.1` in Railway. If you define `HOST`, use `0.0.0.0`.

For model configuration outside this app:

1. Configure the model to use `prompts/barry-system.prompt.xml` as Barry's system prompt.
2. Generate a session-specific integration manifest that conforms to `schemas/integration-manifest.schema.json`.
3. Inject the manifest into model context on each turn where integrations may matter.
4. Route all host actions through a confirmation gate before execution.
5. Run the evaluation conversations before shipping changes to the prompt or integration layer.

## Runtime Context Contract

Barry works best when the host application supplies fresh context on coding and integration-heavy turns:

- Active repository context: directory structure, relevant files, open editor state, diffs, and terminal logs.
- Installed skills/integrations manifest: name, category, connection state, capability descriptions, auth requirements, and trigger phrases.
- Action execution affordances: which actions are available, which are consequential, and whether the user has already confirmed the exact action.

## API Runtime

The local server exposes:

- `GET /api/health`: returns server mode and configured model.
- `POST /api/chat`: accepts `{ "messages": [...] }` and returns a Barry response.

The server reads Barry's instructions directly from `prompts/barry-system.prompt.xml`.
This keeps the web app and workspace-agent prompt aligned.
If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing, `/api/chat` returns a `503` JSON error with
`code: "missing_openai_api_key"`. If `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is missing while the
DeepSeek provider is selected, `/api/chat` returns `code:
"missing_deepseek_api_key"`. If a provider request fails, the API returns the
actual HTTP status when available and the chat UI displays that diagnostic
instead of saving a fake assistant response.

The chat header includes an AI provider dropdown. Choose `OpenAI / ChatGPT` to
use OpenAI's Responses API, or `DeepSeek` to use DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible
Chat Completions API.

## Consequential Actions

The prompt asks Barry to confirm before consequential actions, but the host application should enforce the gate. Treat these as consequential by default:

- Spending money or changing budgets.
- Publishing or sending external-facing content.
- Deploying code to production.
- Deleting data or destructive file operations.
- Changing billing, auth, or external service connections.
